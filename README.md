This project analyses a healthcare insurance dataset (USA) to understand how personal and geographic attributes influence medical insurance charges. It identifies key patterns and provides simple predictive models to estimate costs.

The analysis includes:

**Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL):**

- Handling categorical variables (e.g., smoker, sex, region)
- Creating meaningful features like BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese)

**Data Visualisation:**

- Exploring trends across age, gender, region, and smoking status
- Correlation analysis of numerical and categorical variables

**Predictive Modelling:**

- Using regression models to predict insurance charges based on user profiles


This project is ideal for demonstrating practical skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and model development using real-world health data.


### Key Technologies:

The following Python tools and libraries are used:
- Jupyter Notebook – For running and explaining code in an interactive format
- pandas – For data loading, cleaning, and transformation
- numpy – For numerical operations and feature creation
- matplotlib & seaborn – For static charts and exploratory data analysis
- plotly – For interactive visualisations
- scikit-learn – For building and evaluating predictive models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)

### Use Cases:

The project can be adapted or extended for:

- Healthcare policy planning: Understanding which groups incur higher insurance costs
- Insurance companies: Estimating premiums based on customer profiles
- Personal finance apps: Predicting healthcare-related expenses for users
- Data science portfolios: Showcasing skills in ETL, EDA, feature engineering, and modelling
